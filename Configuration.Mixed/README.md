[![Download sources](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-sources-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata-samples/raw/main/_archives/Configuration.Mixed.zip)

Demonstrates how to implement complex configuration for different environments using
.runsettings files, NUnit parameters, environment variables, `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` and user secrets.

*Don't use all of the approaches together in a project, as no need for such complexity.
Rather choose a couple of approaches to use.*

*[Download sources](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata-samples/raw/main/_archives/Configuration.Mixed.zip),
run tests, check results and experiment with [Atata Framework](https://atata.io).*
